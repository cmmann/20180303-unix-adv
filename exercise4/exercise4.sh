# 1) Look at hello.txt
# 2) In the first ten lines, how many times is the letter 'h' used? (Case sensitive!)
#	Hint: How can you examine just the first ten lines?
#		  Be careful to count 'h' occurrences, AND NOT THE NUMBER OF LINES 
#		    CONTAINING ONE!
#         One of the easiest ways of doing this involves piping the results
#           of grep to ANOTHER grep!

# 3) How many total lines are in the song? (ONLY OUTPUT THE NUMBER)
# 4) How many of those lines do NOT contain the word 'hello'? (Case INSENSITIVE)

# 5) How many of those lines are UNIQUE?
#	Hint: Don't forget to sort!
